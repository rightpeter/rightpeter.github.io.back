# Git and Vimdiff

## More on `git diff`

The most commonly used form is simply `git diff` -- this shows the changes
that are not currently staged for the next commit. If you've already staged
changes, `git diff --cached` will show the difference between the index and
the last commit.

Typing `git diff branch` will show a diff between the current working
directory and the named branch.

I also use `git diff --stat` to see an overview of changes. A related command
that I like to alias is `git log --pretty=format:"[%h] %ae, %ar: %s" --stat`
which shows commit history with the files that were changed.

## Vimdiff

Vimdiff can be run from the command-line with `vimdiff file1 file2 [file3]
[file4]]`. This actually starts Vim in diff mode -- the previous command is
actually equivalent to `vim -d file1 file2 [file3 [file4]]`. Vim requires a
`diff` command to be available for this to work. Vim's documentation on this is
available in `:help diff`.

## Git Settings

Fortunately for us Vim fanatics, it's fairly easy to get Vimdiff working with
Git. Git has a lot of options for working with diffs, and one is `diff.tool`
(man page: `man git-config`). Also related is the `merge.tool` setting which
can be set to allow Vimdiff to be used as the merge resolution program.

These settings can be passed to Git without changing any configuration files:

    git difftool --tool=vimdiff --no-prompt

To tell Git to always use Vimdiff, issue the following commands:

    git config --global diff.tool vimdiff
    git config --global merge.tool vimdiff

Omit `--global` if you just want to set these for the repository in the working
directory. Now typing `git difftool` should bring up Vimdiff.

Another useful option is `difftool.prompt` -- this will stop Vim prompting
about launching `vimdiff`:

    git config --global difftool.prompt false

If you're just trying these commands out, then the prompt will seem annoying,
but there are cases where you might want to ignore a few files so it can be
useful.

## Editing Changed Files

I find myself combining Git's output with `vim -p` on certain occasions when I
want to edit each changed file:

    vim -p `git diff --name-only`
